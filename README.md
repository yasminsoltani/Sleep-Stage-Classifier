# Building a Machine Learning Model for Sleep Stage Classification ðŸ’¤ðŸ¤–ðŸ›Œ

## Introduction
Sleep classification has been a central focus in sleep medicine since the early 20th century, with foundational efforts beginning in the 1930s when researchers first recorded and categorized brain activity during sleep using electroencephalography (EEG).

> ### But what is EEG?
> Think of it as recording your brainâ€™s electrical signals, kind of like placing an antenna on your head to tune into your neural radio station. Different sleep stagesâ€”like light sleep, deep sleep, or REMâ€”have distinct patterns in this brain activity, and thatâ€™s what EEG helps us capture.

But EEG is just one part of the story. In sleep clinics, doctors use something called a polysomnogramâ€”a fancy word for a multi-sensor sleep test. It usually includes EEG (for brain waves), EOG (for eye movements), EMG (for muscle activity), and a few other signals to get a full picture of what your body is doing during sleep. Itâ€™s basically the ultimate sleep selfie. ðŸ¤³

## How does a polysomnogram look like? 
This short video-clip from Harvard Prerau Lab illustrates it perfectly:
